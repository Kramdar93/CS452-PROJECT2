Introduction:
	BounceBall is a simple singleplayer game with the sole goal of
	beating the opponent to a score of 5. Score and other game 
	information is displayed in the console window.
System Requirements:
	Currently the game is Windows only, however the source may be
	editted to use an open source library to import the .bmp files
	fairly easily. A mouse is required.
Rules:
	Although the court displayed implies a ruleset similar to
	tennis, it is much more lenient. If the ball hits on the 
	opponent's side of the court, within the green area (the small
	strip of red just behind it is also valid) the player scores
	a point and vice versa. Anywhere else is out of bounds and the
	ball is reset, no penalty. The player always serves. First to 
	5 wins.
Controls: 
	The player is moved with the mouse in a one-to-one fashion.
	touching the ball is sufficient to bounce it.
